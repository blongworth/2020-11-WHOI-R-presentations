## People tend to organize their projects like this:

# Why is this bad for reproducibility?

1. Which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified?
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions.
3. Takes a lot of time to find
things.
4. How are data, code and product linked?

# A good project layout will make your life easier

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data.
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor).
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission.
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

# Best practices for project organization

There's no one best way, but whatever you choose should make sense to you. It should also make sense to collaborators, including future you.

## Treat data as read only

* Need to be confident that the data is the data and hasn't been changed
* Data can be accidentally modified when working in the original file (e.g., in Excel)
* Separate data from analysis and treat it as read-only

--

## Data Cleaning

Raw data often needs processing or "cleaning" before it's used in analyses.

* Clean data with scripts where possible (exact instructions if not)
* Keep data cleaning scripts with the project
* Store cleaned data in a separate directory

---

## Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: output should
be able to be reproduced using your scripts and data.

There are lots of different ways to manage this output. Having an output folder
with different sub-directories for each separate analysis makes it easier later.

--

## Separate function definition and application

* Start simple: script or notebook with exploratory analysis
* Pull out units of code as functions
* Split functions into separate file, source to use in analysis scripts
* Create directory of function scripts when things get complicated.

> # Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing
>
> [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:
>
> 1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
> 2. Put text documents associated with the project in the `doc` directory.
> 3. Put raw data and metadata in the `data` directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a `results` directory.
> 4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the `src` directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the `bin` directory.
> 5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.

# A project workflow

### It's **OK** to start simple!

Projects often start with a single script, notebook, or some commands in the console.

* When you start acquiring data, make a `data` directory
* When you have code you want to keep (even just a line or two), make a script or notebook and put it in an `R` or `src` folder
* When your data gathering/cleaning code gets complex, turn it into a separate script
* When you start copying and pasting code, make a function
* When you have a couple of functions, make a script of functions and use `source()` to load them in other files.
* When you have functions useful outside the project, make a package

# Version Control

Version control is another essential piece of project organization and reproducibility. We'll talk much more about this next time!

---

# A possible solution: the RStudio Project

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management functionality. RStudio projects:

* keep projects separate (files and more important: environment)
* encourage good project structure
* make version control easy(er)

## Lets make a project for the course!
